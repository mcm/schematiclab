//     prior — `false` for booleans is usually right but not always).
//   - A removed block should fall back to a substitute rather than air.
//   - A property value enum was renamed (e.g. `axis=none` → `axis=y`).
//
// Each entry below documents the version transition it covers. Renames are
// applied bidirectionally by the runtime; the rest are one-directional unless
// noted.
